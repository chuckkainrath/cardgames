                Jeb did not know he wanted to be a software engineer until he wrote
                his first line of working code. It was a new type of satisfaction
                unlike he never experienced before. The more he learned the more he
                realized he didnâ€™t know, and he wanted to know more. Before
                writing that first line of code, He was a chef for 15 years.
                Luckily, he found coding and never wanted to go back to a
                hot kitchen. What he loves about coding is the same for what he
                love about cooking: the creativity. He finds a deep satisfaction in
                creating an application from scratch, building it how he wants and
                calling it his own.
